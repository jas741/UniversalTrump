Tweak of Universal Paperclips : The Trump Version

Trump is basically a bot: he feeds on likes and property and endorsement deals. He is clearly artificial; whether he is intelligent we leave to the reader. How much of the universe might he consume if we let him?

(This is a tweak of decisionproblem.com's universal paperclip game. Still in progress).
